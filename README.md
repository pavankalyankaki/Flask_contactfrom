📬 Flask Contact Form

Flask Contact Form is a lightweight web application built using the Flask framework that allows users to submit their contact details and a message via a simple, responsive contact form. The form captures inputs like name, email, subject, and message, and then processes or stores them (typically sent to an email or saved in a database, depending on configuration).
